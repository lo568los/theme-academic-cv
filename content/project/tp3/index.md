This project is a part of an term paper project in my 6th semester course E2 210 (Quantum Error Correcting Codes) instructed by Prof. Naveen Kashyap at IISc Bangalore. This was a joint report by me and Gurkirat Singh, a senior year student at IISc Bangalore. The project mostly concerned itself with the theoretical framework of floquet codes, and tries to present rigorous proofs for all the claims made in the original paper by hastings and Haah (https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-10-19-564/). A small abstract from our report is presented below:

"This term project attempts to describe the key features of the honeycomb code, a novel quantum error correcting code, leveraging dynamically generated logical qubits. Despite being a subsystem code, the measurement strategies enable the creation of logical qubits, facilitating fault-tolerant quantum memory. The code closely resembles the two-dimensional toric code, employing two-qubit Pauli measurements for each operation."
