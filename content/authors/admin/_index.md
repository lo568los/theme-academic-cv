I am a fourth-year undegraduate student at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. My research interests include Quantum Information theory in Physics and Quantum computing including quantum algorithms, complexity classes and QML, but always open to exploring new topics in these two broad fields. I have also worked on topics of theoretical physics including Statistical mechanics of lattice systems and applied Quantum Optics, as I believe that to fully understand the field of Quantum computing, I have to study and work on the combined fields of Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science, which is reflected in my coursework and projects at IISc.
